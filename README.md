# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

Using a weather API we have created a website that looks at your location and displays the type of weather and temperature to then give suggestions on the type of clothing you should wear.

## Tools and Technology Used

This application currently uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

## Plans for Improvement

Implementing a responsive design for use on mobile and other smaller devices.
Include adding more weather types and clothing recommendations.
Eventually users will be able to add their own clothing selections for different weather variations.
It'd also be great to update weather location automatically by IP address location.
